# 2025-05-19 - Day 43 | Mocking
## Doubles
- Dummies: dummy value, no data, just a placeholder
- Fakes: some kind of data
- Stubs: returning a value
- Spies: info about how functions are used
- Mocks

## Dependency Injection
With `Mock.sideffect()` we need to add a return value to the function we pass to it if we wanted it to have a return value (it replaces `mock.return_value()`)
The order of their precedence is:



## Mocks `unittest.mock`
1. `side_effect`
1. `return_value`
1. `wraps`

Alternative [`pytest-mock`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock/)
- mocks are callable and return other mocks
- we can create new attributes
- we can execute arbitrary code using side_effects
- we can determine how may times a mock is called
