Code is something that you read much more often than you write it
## Testing
1. To have confidence to make changes over time
2. to have confidence in our code and that id does what it's supposed to do

### Test Driven Development TDD
    Write tests first solutions second
1. Forces us to define behaviors up front
2. We get better coverage - it's harder for us to miss edge cases/ subtle behaviours
3. Incremental buildup of complexity
4. Living Documentation
5. Would you *actually* write the tests after?

writting tests first makes sure our functions are actually testable as well
### Anatomy of a test
1. Description
    what behavior of the function are we testing?
2. Assertion

### Important notes:
- Tests will pass by default, they will only fail if an assertion goes wrong
- `assert` keyword belongs to python and it will throw an error if the assertion is `False`
- filename should start with `test_`
- test functions start with the word `test_`
- name of the test is name of the function
- Write a test and make sure it fails first
- Then change the code we are testing to make the test pass
- potentially refactor code later

### Benefits of TDD
- unknown unknowns are revealed


### Running tests
```bash
pytest -vvvrP

```
For anyone interested the meaning of the pytest flags:
-vv = very verbose output
-r = gives a report summary
-P = if part of the r flag and it means pytest should include tests that passed but had captured output (e.g., from print() statements)

Running tests on a specific file

```bash
pytest -vvvrP path/filename.py

```

Running a specific test inside a file
```bash
pytest -vvvrP path/filename.py::test_name

```

### Arrange, Act, Assert
- Arrange the data we will work with
- Act is doing the implementation
- Assert is checking the result
```python
def test_if_passed_an_empty_string_should_return_zero():
    #Arrange
    empty_string = ''
    expected_result = 0

    #Act
    result = sum_alphabet_indices(empty_string)

    #Assert
    assert result == expected_result
```

### Types of tests
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Smoke testing
- User acceptance testing
- End-to-end testing

## Virtual environments (venv)
Commands to run a virtual environment
```bash
# setup venv
python -m venv venv 

# add venv to gitignore
touch .gitignore
echo -e "venv\n*__pycache__\n*pytest_cache\n.pytest_cache" > .gitignore

# set PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)

# activate venv
source venv/bin/activate

# optionally install packages into virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
is there a way to keep it activate for any terminal instances in that directory (like a package.json) 

To get out of the python environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
