# Day 3
## Algorithms and Problem Solving
### Learning Objectives:
- Know the meaning of an algorithm.
- Be able to use pseudocode to map out a problem.
- Be able to distinguish a valid step of pseudocode from an invalid one.
### ALgorithm
- A series of instructions
- designed to execute some tasks or operations that would solve a larger problem
- typically represented as functions in Python

### Pseudocode
- High level description of code
- breaks the problem down into small manageable chinks
- Very useful when thinking about how to solve larger problems

- Are there versions of python list methods that return a new list?
