# 2025-04-02 - Notes
## Encapsulation
we only interact with a class via it's public methods
## Private Atributes
## Python's name mangling
by default python gives the property that starts with `__` a more convoluted name using the class name as a prefix

you can find the name given to the private attribute using the `__dir__` method
## Getters and Setters
Are methods that are used as if they were properties from the user standpoint of a class
we use the `@property` decorator to create getters and we should ideally return a deep copy if it's a mutable data structure

```python
from copy import deepcopy
class Person:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.__full_name = f'{self.first_name} {self.last_name}'

    # getter
    @property
    def full_name(self):
        return deepcopy(self.__full_name)

    # setter we need to use the name of the getter
    @full_name.setter
    def full_name(self, new_value):
        self.__full_name = new_value
```

## Class Attribute
Class attribute are available in all instances of the class but are initially defined on the class itself not on instances of the class. 
- if they are ever changed on the instance of a class only that instance is changed
- if they are changed in the class itself, every instance inherits the change unless the attribute has been changed in the instance itself at any point. In that case, the attribute will always be the value it was changed to in the instance, no matter how many changes are made to the attribute in the class itself


```python
from copy import deepcopy
class Person:
    # Class attribute available in all instances of the class but lives on the class itself not on instances of the class
    species = 'Homo sapiens'


    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.__full_name = f'{self.first_name} {self.last_name}'

    @property
    def full_name(self):
        return deepcopy(self.__full_name)

    @full_name.setter
    def full_name(self, new_value):
        self.__full_name = new_value
```

## Class Methods
Class methods are available in the class itself not on instances of the class

```python
from copy import deepcopy
class Person:
    species = 'Homo sapiens'

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.__full_name = f'{self.first_name} {self.last_name}'

    @property
    def full_name(self):
        return deepcopy(self.__full_name)

    @full_name.setter
    def full_name(self, new_value):
        self.__full_name = new_value
    
    # Class methods do not take self but the class itself as first argument
    @classmethod
    def copy(cls, person_instance):
        return deepcopy(person_instance)
```
