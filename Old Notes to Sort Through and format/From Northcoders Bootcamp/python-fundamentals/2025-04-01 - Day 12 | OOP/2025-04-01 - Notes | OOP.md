## OPP
Some Terms:
    - `object`, `instance`, `class`, `constructor`, `method`, `attribute`
OOP is a programming paradigm.
It's a different way of structuring code so that a program's information and behaviours are bundled into a single object
- Dot notation allows us to make use of methods and attributes


### Object:
Artefacts in memory that store data and behaviour.
An object is defined by a class
An object is an instance of a class
We can design our own classes that act as an "object factory"

### Class
- Blueprint to create instances of it
- Classes are named with upper CamelCase
- Instances are not CamelCase they are snake_case

#### Constructor
- `self` is a reference to the object itself
```python

class Person():
    # constructor
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = 'Jeff'

```

### Non Public Attributes
By convention a non public attribute's name should start with a `_` to signal to users that they should not be interacting 

### Checking if property is a method
```python
import types

assert type(person.name) == 'types.MethodType'

```

### Non Public Attributes
By convention a non public attribute's name should start with a `_` to signal to users that they should not be interacting 

### Checking if property is a method
```python
import types

assert type(person.name) == 'types.MethodType'

```

### Methods
- should do one thing and do it well
