# 2025-04-15 SQL - Notes
## SQL
### SQL Agregate functions
- AVG()
- COUNT()
- etc

### Groups
Generally speaking the thing you want to group by is the Primary Key
```sql
SELECT artists.artist_name, COUNT(albums.album_id) AS total_albums_released
FROM albums
RIGHT JOIN artists ON artists.artists_id = albums.artist_id
GROUP BY artists.artists_id
```

### Junction Tables
- To solve many to many relationships
- convention is the name of both tables eg.: `artists_genres`

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artists_genres
artist_id INT REFERENCES artists(artist_id)
genre_id INT REFERENCES genre(genre_id)
PRIMARY KEY (artist_id, genre_id); -- composite primary key enforces uniqueness in this relationship
```
- composite primary keys do not create a column, they are only a table constraint

Querying all artists and their genres
```sql
SELECT artists.name, genres.genre
FROM artists
INNER JOIN artists_genres
ON artists.artist_id = artists_genres.artist_id
INNER JOIN genres
ON genres.genre_id = artists_genres.genre_id;
```

### `INTERSECT` method
Only things that exist in both tables

### `EXCEPT` method
Only things that only exist on the left table

### `CASE` statements
```sql
SELECT danger_rating,
    CASE
        WHEN danger_rating >= 9 THEN 'very dangerous'
        WHEN danger_rating <= 6 THEN 'not dangerous'
        ELSE 'dangerous'
        END how_dangerous --this is the new column alias
FROM bears;
```
