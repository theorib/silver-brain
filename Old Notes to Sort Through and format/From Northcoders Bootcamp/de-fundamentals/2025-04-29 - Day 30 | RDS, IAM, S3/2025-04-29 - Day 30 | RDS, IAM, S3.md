# 2025-04-29 - Day 30 | RDS, IAM, S3 Notes
## S3 Simple Storage Service
- Storing and accessing files
- Organised into buckets
    - A collection of objects
    - We can control access to objects with IAM
    - Very cost effient, huge amounts of data for relatively little cost
    - Folders are just syntactic sugar, S3 just prepends the asset key with the string folder name

## IAM (Identity Access Management)
- Controls permissions, who can access what
- Can create users, give them access to your account
- Can be used for people who can log into the consoles
- Can be used for services e.g. give an EC2 access to another service
