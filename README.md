# Silver Brain ðŸ§ 

## My Programming Learning Journey

Welcome to my digital brain! This repository contains my personal notes, references, and documentation from my journey learning to program. Think of it as my "second brain" - a place where I store everything I learn, troubleshoot, and discover along the way.

## What You'll Find Here

This is an **Obsidian vault** containing organised notes about:

- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, Python, and more
- **Data Engineering**: Python-based data pipelines, ETL processes, and analytics from my intensive 3-month bootcamp at Northcoders
- **Tools & Technologies**: Git workflows, AWS CLI, Linux commands
- **Development Practices**: Testing frameworks, Git hooks, best practices
- **Troubleshooting**: Real problems I've encountered and how I solved them
- **Daily Learning**: Notes from my daily programming journey

## Getting Started with This Repository

### Option 1: View in Obsidian (Recommended)

To get the full experience with linked notes, graph view, and interactive features:

#### 1. Install Obsidian

**Desktop:**
- Download from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
- Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux

**Mobile:**
- iOS: Download from the App Store
- Android: Download from Google Play Store

#### 2. Clone and Open the Vault

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/silver-brain.git

# Open Obsidian and select "Open folder as vault"
# Navigate to the cloned silver-brain directory
```

#### 3. Explore the Notes

- Use `Ctrl/Cmd + O` to quickly open any note
- Try the Graph View to see how notes connect
- Browse by folders or use tags to find topics

### Option 2: Browse on GitHub

You can read the markdown files directly on GitHub, though you'll miss the linking and graph features that make Obsidian special.

## How This Vault Works

### Note Organization Philosophy

> **"Tags categorize, Links connect"**

- **Tags** answer: "What type of note is this?"
- **Links** answer: "What else should I know about this topic?"

### Automated Git Workflow

This vault uses the Obsidian Git plugin for automatic version control:
- Auto-commits every 5 minutes
- Commit message format: `vault backup: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`
- Syncs changes automatically

### Content Types

1. **Reference Notes**: Structured documentation about specific technologies
2. **Daily Notes**: Time-based entries tracking my learning progress
3. **Troubleshooting**: Problem-solution pairs from real coding challenges
