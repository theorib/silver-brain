# First Class Functions

Functions in most programming languages can be either [[First-Class Functions]] or [[Higher-Order Functions]].

## First-Class Functions
Functions are First-Class in a programming language when they are treated as any other value. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions or returned from other functions.  

## Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are functions that accept a function as an argument and/or return a function

[[JavaScript]] and [[Python]] support both [[First-class Functions]] and [[Higher-Order Functions]].
