# Functional Programming

The goal of functional programming (vs procedural programming and object-oriented programming) is to make our code more declarative by hiding implementation details and letting users tell us what the end result they want, not how they want it done.

Functional programming cares about a few things:
1. Immutability
2. No Side Effects
3. Purity

Important Themes in functional programming are:
- [[Higher-order functions]]
- [[First-class functions]]
- [[Pure Functions]]
- [[Recursion]]
- [[Closures]]
- [[Currying]]
