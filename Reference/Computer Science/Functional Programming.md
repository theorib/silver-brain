# Functional Programming

The goal of functional programming (vs procedural programming and object-oriented programming) is to make our code more declarative by hiding implementation details and letting users tell us what the end result they want, not how they want it done.

Functional programming cares about a few things:
1. Immutability
2. No [[Side Effects]]
3. [[Purity]]

Functional programming encourages the use of [[Expressions]] over [[Statements]]. Expressions always return a value, and this allows for [[chaining]] and [[composability]], which can only be achieved reliably when functions are pure, have no [[Side Effects]] and return the expected value.

Important Themes in functional programming are:
- [[Higher-order functions]]
- [[First-class functions]]
- [[Pure Functions]]
- [[Recursion]]
- [[Closures]]
- [[Currying]]

## [[Functional Programming]] vs [[Object-oriented Programming]]

Out of the four pillars of OOP, the only one that doesn't fit with functional programming is [[inheritance]]
