# The Four Pillars of [[Object-oriented Programming]] (OOP)


## [[Encapsulation]]
Encapsulation is about hiding the internal state and implementation details
## [[Abstraction]]
Abstraction is about creating a simple interface for complex behaviour
## [[Inheritance]]
Inheritance allows a "child" class to _inherit_ properties and methods from a "parent" class.
## [[Polymorphism]]
