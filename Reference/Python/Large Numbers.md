# Large Numbers and Scientific Notation

In python, we can represent large numbers using `_` for readability, such as `100_000_000` or using scientific notation which automatically makes the number a float.

To write a number in scientific notation we first write a number and then the letters `e` or `E` followed by the a number which specifies the how many places to move the decimal to the right for a positive number or to the left for a negative number:

`100e6` is equal to `100_000_000.0` or `100e-1` which is equal to `10.0`.

Scientific notation is useful to write numbers that are too big or too small to conveniently write in a normal way.
