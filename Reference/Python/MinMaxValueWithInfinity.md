# Finding min and max values starting from infinity
We start at negative infinity `Float("-inf")` when initialising a variable that will be used to find the maximum value in a list because every value in the list will be greater than negative infinity. Conversely, we can use positive infinity `Float("inf")` when looking for the minimum value since every value will be smaller than infinity.
