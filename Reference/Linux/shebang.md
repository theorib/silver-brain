A shebang is a special line at the top of a file that tells your shell which interpreter to use to execute that file.

The format of shebang is:
```
#! interpreter_programe [optional_args]
```

For example a program meant to be executed in bash may have the following shebang:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```
